  "interview_notes": {
    "security_concepts": [
      "ccTLD abuse: Using Polish .pl TLD to impersonate roblox.com via a hyphenated lookalike domain (roblox-com.pl)",
      "GitHub Pages hosting abuse: Attacker leveraged free GitHub Pages hosting (185.199.108-111.153) to serve phishing content at zero cost with high uptime and built-in HTTPS",
      "Let's Encrypt certificate abuse: Free DV certificate provides HTTPS padlock icon, demonstrating that padlock != trustworthy -- it only means encrypted transport, not site legitimacy",
      "Domain registrar obfuscation: OVH SAS registrar with individual registrant type and Polish WHOIS redaction makes attacker attribution difficult",
      "SPF record configuration: Attacker set up SPF (v=spf1 include:mx.ovh.com -all) and MX records, suggesting potential for credential-harvesting email campaigns or receiving exfiltrated data via email",
      "TXT record redirect hint: The TXT record '1|www.roblox-com.pl' is an OVH-specific redirect indicator pointing bare domain to www subdomain",
      "Certificate Transparency as OSINT: CT logs revealed the full timeline of the domain's phishing operations and linked it to a sibling domain roblox-com.us",
      "Infrastructure commoditization: The entire phishing stack (OVH domain, GitHub Pages hosting, Let's Encrypt TLS) costs effectively nothing, lowering the barrier to entry for phishing campaigns"
    ],
    "talking_points": [
      "The domain resolves to GitHub Pages IPs (185.199.108-111.153) with reverse DNS confirming cdn-185-199-110-153.github.com -- this means the attacker is hosting their phishing kit as a GitHub Pages site, abusing GitHub's free hosting infrastructure",
      "Currently returning HTTP 404, indicating the phishing content has been taken down (likely via GitHub abuse report) but the domain infrastructure remains active with valid DNS, WHOIS, and a current TLS certificate",
      "Certificate Transparency reveals two distinct operational periods: an initial campaign in January-February 2023 (4 certs across 3 weeks), then a ~2.5 year dormancy period, followed by reactivation in November 2025. This pattern suggests either a persistent threat actor reusing infrastructure or a domain that was re-registered",
      "WHOIS shows domain was created 2025-11-04, but CT logs show certificates from January 2023 -- this means the domain was previously registered, expired, and was re-registered (potentially by the same or different operator)",
      "A critical CT log finding: a January 2023 certificate for 'roblox-com.us' included 'roblox-com.pl' as a SAN, directly linking both phishing domains to the same operator running parallel ccTLD phishing campaigns (.pl and .us)",
      "Missing ALL standard security headers (CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options) -- while GitHub Pages provides minimal headers, a legitimate site would have these, and their absence is consistent with a hastily deployed phishing page",
      "The OVH nameservers (dns16.ovh.net, ns16.ovh.net) combined with OVH MX records show the attacker used a single provider (OVH) for domain registration, DNS, and email, then pointed the A records to GitHub Pages for free static hosting",
      "Let's Encrypt R3 -> R13 issuer migration between the two operational periods reflects Let's Encrypt's own infrastructure changes, not an attacker action"
    ],
    "notable_findings": [
      "CROSS-DOMAIN LINK: CT logs reveal roblox-com.us was issued a certificate that included roblox-com.pl as a SAN (2023-01-29), proving the same operator runs phishing campaigns across multiple ccTLDs",
      "TWO-PHASE OPERATION: The domain shows a Jan-Feb 2023 campaign phase (ZeroSSL + Let's Encrypt R3 certs), a ~2.5 year gap, then reactivation Nov 2025 (Let's Encrypt R13) -- the WHOIS creation date of 2025-11-04 confirms re-registration",
      "CURRENTLY 404: Despite having valid DNS, active WHOIS, and a current TLS cert (valid until April 2026), the site returns a GitHub Pages 404, suggesting recent takedown of the phishing content but persistence of the supporting infrastructure",
      "FULL EMAIL INFRASTRUCTURE: MX records pointing to OVH mail servers plus SPF records suggest the attacker configured email capability, possibly for receiving stolen credentials or sending phishing lures from the lookalike domain",
      "ZERO-COST ATTACK STACK: Domain (~$5/year via OVH), hosting (free GitHub Pages), TLS (free Let's Encrypt), email (free OVH MX) -- total cost under $10/year for a credible phishing operation",
      "ANYCAST IP: ipinfo.io confirms the GitHub Pages IPs are anycast, meaning the phishing content was served from edge locations worldwide for low latency -- ironically better infrastructure than many legitimate sites",
      "VARNISH/FASTLY CACHING: The x-served-by and via headers show Fastly/Varnish CDN caching in front of GitHub Pages, giving the phishing site enterprise-grade performance and DDoS protection for free"
    ]
  }
