      "This domain tells a complete story of phishing infrastructure evolution: original Roblox phishing with full cPanel hosting (2022) -> dormancy -> revival (2024) -> expiration -> re-registration by new operator for Discord OAuth theft (2025). The .ge ccTLD domain was attractive enough to be re-registered after expiry.",
      "The 403 Forbidden on the bare domain but 200 OK on path-based URLs (from urlscan) suggests the server uses path-based routing -- it only serves content for specific Roblox-mimicking URL patterns (/games/, /users/, /communities/) and blocks direct access, which is an anti-analysis technique.",
      "The Eggy-Wall header (v10.0.0) and custom NS infrastructure suggest a branded hosting/proxy service purpose-built for phishing operations. This is infrastructure-as-a-service for phishing, not a one-off setup.",
      "WHOIS 'HiddenInWhois' status at the .ge registry level means the registrant data is fully suppressed -- more opaque than typical GDPR redaction seen in gTLD WHOIS.",
      "The cert for 'fuck.roblox.com.ge' (2026-01-27) shows the operator is still actively developing the infrastructure and adding new subdomains, potentially for additional attack vectors or testing.",
      "URL shortener usage (is.gd redirecting to roblox.com.ge) adds another layer of indirection that complicates detection and makes links look less suspicious in Discord messages.",
      "The 3,755 urlscan results (source: openphish) indicate this domain has massive scale -- it's not a targeted attack but a broad credential harvesting campaign.",
      "The reverse proxy technique means every phishing page is dynamically generated from real Roblox data -- any valid user ID produces a convincing profile page, and the content updates automatically as Roblox changes their UI. This is fundamentally different from static phishing kits that require manual updates.",
      "The injected script is only ~30 lines of clear JavaScript hidden among 95+ legitimate Roblox bundles. Finding it is like finding a needle in a haystack unless you know to look for non-Roblox inline scripts and non-standard meta tags.",
      "The 'Join Experience' button hijack is a brilliant social engineering choice: it exploits a real Roblox UX feature (joining a friend's game) and the presence spoofing (showing the user as 'playing') creates natural motivation to click it."

      "Domain has been through 3 operators/phases over 4 years (2022-2026), showing how phishing domains get recycled",
      "Current WHOIS creation date (2025-08-21) mismatches first CT cert (2022-04-29) by 3+ years -- proving the domain was re-registered, not continuously held",
      "Original operator had full cPanel infrastructure (cpanel, webmail, autodiscover, ftp, smtp, pop, mail subdomains) suggesting shared hosting or VPS",
      "Current operator uses eggywall.cc custom nameservers and WIBO Baltic UAB hosting -- a completely different infrastructure stack from the original Cloudflare/cPanel setup",
      "X-Frame-Options: ALLOWALL is deliberately insecure -- allows phishing pages to be embedded in iframes, useful for credential harvesting overlays",
      "No MX/TXT records means no email or SPF/DKIM -- the current operator has no interest in email, only web-based OAuth phishing",
      "TLS cert expires 2026-02-18 (11 days from analysis) -- if not renewed, the HTTPS phishing pages will show certificate warnings",
      "auth.immortal.rs CNAMEs to customers.vaultcord.com -> Vercel -- Vaultcord uses legitimate cloud infrastructure (Vercel) making it harder to block at the IP level",
      "3,755 urlscan results flagged by OpenPhish demonstrate the domain is well-known to threat intelligence feeds but remains operational",
      "The domain serves different Roblox page types (games with privateServerLinkCode, user profiles, communities) suggesting automated content generation mimicking the real roblox.com URL structure",
      "Reverse proxy confirmed: different Machine IDs per request, real Roblox analytics/Sentry endpoints proxied, environment-meta data-domain='roblox.com'",
      "Only 3 elements injected into proxied pages: secret meta tag, modified login href, and 30-line script block -- minimal footprint, maximum impact",
      "Client-capability detection: curl/wget get Roblox 404 error page, browsers get full profile page with injection -- most automated scanners miss the malicious payload",
      "The secret value '1405351214488189' is 16 digits, consistent with Discord snowflake ID format -- may be a Vaultcord tracking parameter or Discord application ID",
      "Presence spoofing every 300ms creates social engineering urgency ('this user is playing right now, join them') -- specific to profile page variant",
      "Login navbar href also rewritten to /login?returnUrl={secret} -- both Join Experience button AND the standard Log In link trigger the OAuth redirect"
