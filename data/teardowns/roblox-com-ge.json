      "ccTLD abuse: .ge (Georgia) is used as a ccTLD_append attack (roblox.com + .ge), exploiting that roblox.com.ge looks like a subdomain of roblox.com to untrained eyes. This is part of the 67.4% ccTLD_append pattern observed across the dataset.",
      "OAuth scope abuse: Vaultcord uses Discord's OAuth2 flow to steal tokens. The authorization request likely includes scopes like guilds.join (add victim to attacker servers), identify (get user info), and email. Victims see a real Discord consent screen, making the attack feel legitimate.",
      "Infrastructure separation: The phishing lure (roblox.com.ge on WIBO Baltic) and credential harvesting (auth.immortal.rs on Vercel/AWS) use completely separate infrastructure, making takedown harder -- killing one doesn't kill the other.",
      "Bulletproof hosting indicators: eggywall.cc custom nameservers, WIBO Baltic UAB hosting, .cc TLD for infrastructure, X-Frame-Options: ALLOWALL, and HiddenInWhois status all suggest deliberate abuse-resistant hosting choices.",

      "Verification-as-a-service: Vaultcord (vaultcord.win / customers.vaultcord.com) is a commercial service that provides Discord OAuth token theft capability to customers. The phishing domain operator is a Vaultcord customer, not the service operator. This is cybercrime-as-a-service.",

The .ge ccTLD domain was attractive enough to be re-registered after expiry.",
      "The 403 Forbidden on the bare domain but 200 OK on path-based URLs (from urlscan) suggests the server uses path-based routing -- it only serves content for specific Roblox-mimicking URL patterns (/games/, /users/, /communities/) and blocks direct access, which is an anti-analysis technique.",
      "The Eggy-Wall header (v10.0.0) and custom NS infrastructure suggest a branded hosting/proxy service purpose-built for phishing operations. This is infrastructure-as-a-service for phishing, not a one-off setup.",

      "The cert for 'fuck.roblox.com.ge' (2026-01-27) shows the operator is still actively developing the infrastructure and adding new subdomains, potentially for additional attack vectors or testing.",
      "URL shortener usage (is.gd redirecting to roblox.com.ge) adds another layer of indirection that complicates detection and makes links look less suspicious in Discord messages.",
